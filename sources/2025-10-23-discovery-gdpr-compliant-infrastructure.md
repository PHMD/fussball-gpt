# GDPR-Compliant Tech Stack Discovery: German Sports AI MVP

**Research Date**: October 23, 2025
**Focus**: Backend-as-a-Service, Analytics, Authentication, and Hosting solutions for GDPR compliance in Germany

## Executive Summary

This discovery research identifies GDPR-compliant infrastructure options for building a German sports AI MVP. Key findings:

1. **Supabase** offers the strongest combination: EU data residency (Frankfurt), available DPA, same-DB architecture eliminates sync complexity, competitive pricing
2. **Privacy-first analytics** (Plausible, Fathom, Umami) eliminate cookie consent requirements entirely
3. **Clerk** provides the most comprehensive auth solution with Data Privacy Framework certification and EU hosting
4. **Vercel** offers EU regions but requires careful DPA configuration; alternatives like Railway and Fly.io available
5. **Total MVP cost**: €30-50/month for anonymous users, €80-150/month with authentication

**Critical Discovery**: The Schrems II decision (2020) invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield, making EU data residency + DPA essential for any US-based provider.

---

## 1. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) Comparison

### Supabase (RECOMMENDED)

**GDPR Compliance:**
- ✅ EU hosting available (eu-central-1 Frankfurt)
- ✅ DPA available (request via dashboard or support@supabase.io)
- ✅ Data never leaves EU when hosted in EU region
- ✅ Open-source (data portability guaranteed)
- ⚠️ Must explicitly select EU region on project creation

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Shared database architecture**: Auth uses same PostgreSQL DB as application → eliminates sync complexity
2. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: GDPR access control at database layer
3. **Mature ecosystem**: Most similar to Firebase with better compliance story
4. **Transparent pricing**: Predictable costs vs. Firebase's per-operation charges

**Pricing:**
- Free tier: Up to 500MB database, 1GB file storage, 2GB bandwidth
- Pro: $25/month (8GB database, 100GB storage, 250GB bandwidth)
- Team: $599/month (unlimited projects)

**GDPR Implementation:**
- Enable RLS policies for all tables handling personal data
- Use `auth.jwt()` function to extract user claims in policies
- Request DPA via dashboard (required for compliance)
- Configure automatic data deletion workflows

---

### Firebase

**GDPR Compliance:**
- ✅ EU regions available (europe-west1 Belgium, europe-west3 Frankfurt, etc.)
- ✅ DPA available through Google Cloud
- ❌ Still subject to US CLOUD Act even with EU hosting
- ❌ Proprietary technology (vendor lock-in risk)

**Challenges:**
1. **Schrems II implications**: EU courts invalidated Privacy Shield; Firebase relies on Standard Contractual Clauses
2. **Cost escalation**: Firestore charges per read/write can reach $2,000 for bulk operations
3. **NoSQL limitations**: Complex queries require denormalization
4. **Random logout issues**: Multiple GitHub reports of session persistence problems

**Pricing:**
- Spark (free): 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day, 1GB storage
- Blaze (pay-as-you-go): $0.06 per 100K reads, $0.18 per 100K writes

**Verdict**: Avoid for GDPR-critical applications due to US jurisdiction concerns and unpredictable costs.

---

## 8. Key Contradictions & Surprises

### Contradictions Found:

1. **Appwrite Cloud GDPR Status**: Forum says NOT compliant, but official docs don't explicitly state this. Self-hosted is clearly compliant.

2. **Vercel EU Hosting**: Markets EU regions, but community reports data still passes through US for DDoS protection. Not a violation but requires disclosure.

3. **Firebase GDPR**: Technically compliant via SCCs, but Schrems II decision makes this legally questionable. Some lawyers advise against it.

4. **Supabase Auth Logout Issues**: Multiple GitHub threads report random logouts, which could impact user experience and indirect GDPR concerns (data loss).

### Surprises:

1. **No Cookie Consent Needed**: All privacy-first analytics eliminate cookie banners entirely. This is a HUGE UX win.

2. **Shared DB = Compliance Win**: Supabase's architecture (auth + app in same DB) eliminates the data sync problem that plagues Firebase/other solutions.

3. **Schrems II Impact**: 2020 decision still causing major headaches for US cloud providers. EU-only providers have significant advantage.

4. **DPA Accessibility**: Most providers make DPA available but not always obvious. Supabase requires support ticket, Vercel has pre-signed download.

5. **Cost of Compliance**: GDPR-compliant stack is NOT more expensive. In some cases (Plausible vs GA360), it's cheaper.

---

## 9. Germany-Specific Considerations

### Legal Framework
- **GDPR** (EU-wide) + **BDSG** (German Federal Data Protection Act)
- **TTDSG** (Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act) - governs cookies
- **BaFin** regulations if handling financial data
- **Shorter deletion periods** may be required under German law

### Hosting Preference
- German companies often prefer German data centers (Frankfurt)
- Cultural expectation of "Made in Germany" quality
- Strong privacy consciousness among users

### Language Requirements
- Privacy policy must be available in German
- Consent forms must use clear, plain German language
- English-only may be acceptable for B2B SaaS

### Recommended German-Friendly Providers
1. **Hetzner** (German company, German data centers)
2. **OVHcloud** (French, Frankfurt DC available)
3. **Supabase eu-central-1** (AWS Frankfurt)
4. **Plausible** (EU-hosted, GDPR-first)

---

## 10. Next Steps for KSI Prototype

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Choose Stack B** (MVP with auth) as baseline
2. **Select Supabase Frankfurt region** for BaaS
3. **Deploy Plausible** for analytics (no cookie banner needed)
4. **Use Supabase Auth** initially (upgrade to Clerk if B2B features needed)
5. **Host on Vercel** with Frankfurt failover regions
