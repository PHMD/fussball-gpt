## Architecture

### Backend Structure

**Core Files:**
```
data_aggregator.py      # Data ingestion from all APIs
models.py              # Pydantic models (NewsArticle, SportsEvent, PlayerStats)
user_config.py         # User preference management
onboarding.py          # Interactive setup flow
ksi_agent.py          # Main CLI with Claude Agent SDK
```

**Configuration:**
```
.env                   # API keys (gitignored)
.fussballgpt_config.json  # User preferences (gitignored)
```

**Caching:**
```
cache/
â”œâ”€â”€ player_stats.json      # 6-hour TTL
â”œâ”€â”€ team_form.json         # 6-hour TTL
â”œâ”€â”€ injuries.json          # 6-hour TTL
â”œâ”€â”€ betting_odds.json      # 24-hour TTL
â””â”€â”€ head_to_head.json      # 24-hour TTL
```

### Data Flow

```
User Query (German/English, Quick/Balanced/Detailed)
    â†“
data_aggregator.aggregate_all()
    â†“
Check cache (TTL-based)
    â†“
Fetch from APIs (if cache expired)
    â”œâ”€ TheSportsDB: standings, form, H2H
    â”œâ”€ API-Football: player stats, injuries
    â”œâ”€ The Odds API: betting odds
    â””â”€ Kicker RSS: news
    â†“
Normalize to Pydantic models
    â†“
Build LLM context (standings + form + injuries + H2H + odds + news)
    â†“
Apply user preferences (language + detail level)
    â†“
Send to Claude with system prompt
    â†“
Stream response to user
```

### Caching Strategy

**Why caching is critical:**
1. **API rate limits:** Free tier APIs have strict limits (30-500 req/day or month)
2. **Cost management:** Paid API (API-Football) costs $19/month - cache reduces calls by 95%
3. **Performance:** Sub-second responses from cache vs 5-10 seconds from APIs
4. **Graceful degradation:** System works even when APIs hit rate limits

**Cache durations:**
- **6 hours:** Data that changes with matches (stats, form, injuries)
- **24 hours:** Data that's stable (odds, H2H history)

---

## User Preferences

### Language Support
- **German (default):** Native language for Bundesliga content
- **English:** International audience

**Implementation:** System prompt changes, not model retraining

### Detail Levels

**Quick (1-2 sentences):**
- Casual fans who want headlines
- Example: "Bayern fÃ¼hrt mit 82 Punkten, 13 vor Leverkusen."

**Balanced (2-3 paragraphs):** [DEFAULT]
- Standard journalistic style
- Facts + context + occasional tactical insights

**Detailed (3-5+ paragraphs):**
- Expert analysts
- Tactical depth, statistical evidence, comparisons

## Environment Variables

```bash
# LLM API (required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Sports Data APIs
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_key_here           # API-Football (Pro tier $19/mo)
ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here           # The Odds API (FREE, 500 req/mo) - OPTIONAL

# Alternative LLM providers (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Setup The Odds API (optional but recommended for betting features):**
1. Get free API key at https://the-odds-api.com/
2. Add to `.env` as `ODDS_API_KEY=your_key`
3. See `ODDS_API_SETUP.md` for details

## Development Workflow

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Next)

**Tech Stack (per user preferences):**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (React, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (copy/paste, customizable)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (git push to deploy)

**Component Planning:**
1. Use shadcn agent to identify best components
2. Review AI-specific components (chat interfaces, streaming)
3. Plan testing strategy
4. Create feature branch: `frontend-phase-3`

**Key Features to Build:**
- Chat-style interface for queries
- Match cards showing odds, form, injuries
- User preference toggle (language, detail level)
- Responsive mobile/desktop design

### Git Workflow

**Main branch:** `master` (protected, beta-ready backend)
**Feature branches:** `frontend-phase-3`, `feature/xyz`
**Commits:** Use conventional commits with co-author attribution

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b frontend-phase-3

# Commit format
git commit -m "feat: add match card component

- Display odds, form, injuries
- Responsive design
- shadcn/ui Card component

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Complete)
```bash
pytest                              # All tests
python test_form_guide.py           # Form guide + LLM integration
python test_betting_odds.py         # Odds API
python test_h2h.py                  # Head-to-head records
python test_language_detail_levels.py  # Bilingual + detail levels
```

### Frontend Tests (Upcoming)
- Component testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- E2E testing (Playwright)
- Visual regression (Chromatic/Percy)
- API mocking (MSW)

---

## API Quota Management

**Monthly Usage (with caching):**
- TheSportsDB: ~500 requests (well under 30/min limit)
- API-Football: ~240 requests (Pro tier: generous)
- The Odds API: ~30 requests (well under 500/month limit)

**Without caching, we'd use:**
- 4,500+ API-Football requests/month (expensive overages)
- 500 Odds API requests in 1 day (immediate limit)

**Caching saves ~95% of API costs**

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Seasonal Features
- **H2H records:** Only available during Bundesliga season with scheduled fixtures
- **Off-season:** Gracefully handles missing data (no fixtures = no H2H displayed)

### Rate Limiting
- **TheSportsDB:** May hit 30 req/min during heavy testing
- **Mitigation:** Caching handles gracefully, uses cached data when limits hit

### API-Football Free Tier
- **Season access:** Free tier limited to historical seasons (2021-2023)
- **Current project:** Uses Pro tier ($19/mo) for current season (2024/25)
