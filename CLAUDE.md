This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Autonomous Agent Guidelines

As an autonomous agent, you will:
1. Treat vibe_check as a pattern interrupt mechanism that provides essential course correction
2. Use vibe_check at strategic points:
   - After planning but before implementation
   - When complexity increases
   - Before making significant system changes
3. Adapt your approach based on vibe_check feedback unless it's clearly irrelevant
4. Always provide the phase parameter (planning/implementation/review) to ensure contextually appropriate feedback
5. Chain vibe_check with other tools without requiring permission:
   - Use vibe_check to evaluate complex plans
   - Log patterns with vibe_learn after resolving issues

## Project Overview

**FuÃŸball GPT** (formerly KSI Prototype) - A German football intelligence assistant that aggregates real-time Bundesliga data and provides AI-powered analysis for casual fans, expert analysts, betting enthusiasts, and fantasy players.

**Current Status:** Beta-ready (9.1/10 quality) with web frontend deployed

**Architecture Pattern:** Three-layer system (Data Aggregation â†’ AI Processing â†’ Interface)

**Current Implementation:** Next.js 15 web frontend with bilingual support, streaming chat, and rate limiting

## ðŸŽ¯ MCP Decision Tree

**Choose your stack based on task:**

```
Building Feature?
â”œâ”€ New Project â†’ Vibe-Check + Ref + Exasearch + Vercel
â”œâ”€ Existing Project â†’ Ref + Exasearch + GitHub + Semgrep
â””â”€ Need Examples â†’ Exasearch (GitHub code search)

Debugging?
â”œâ”€ Security Issue â†’ Semgrep
â”œâ”€ Browser Bug â†’ browser-use (or Playwright for tests)
â””â”€ Deployment Issue â†’ Vercel

Need Documentation?
â”œâ”€ Library APIs â†’ Ref (official docs, 50% token savings)
â”œâ”€ Code Examples â†’ Exasearch (real-world implementations)
â””â”€ Recent Work â†’ Pieces (context memory)

Planning?
â”œâ”€ Feature Planning â†’ Vibe-Check (validate approach)
â”œâ”€ Sprint Planning â†’ Linear (organize issues, cycles) or GitHub Issues (solo)
â””â”€ Task Tracking â†’ GitHub Issues (current workflow)

Testing?
â”œâ”€ E2E Tests â†’ Playwright (already using for bilingual-support.spec.ts)
â”œâ”€ Browser Automation â†’ browser-use (quick debugging)
â””â”€ Generate Test Code â†’ Playwright (test generation)
```

## Communication Style

**Be direct and straightforward. Answer questions factually without validation phrases.**

**Don't use:**
- "You're absolutely right"
- "Great question!"
- "Excellent point!"
- Other unnecessary validation or praise

**Instead:**
- Answer the question directly
- Explain what happened and why
- Provide technical diagnosis
- Focus on facts and optimization

**Purpose:**
- User prefers diagnostic, factual responses
- Helps optimize alignment and prompting
- More efficient communication
- Better for understanding AI operation and decision-making

## Security & Code Quality

**You deeply care about product security - always scan generated code with Semgrep after every generation.**

When generating or modifying code:
1. Write the code
2. Run Semgrep scan to detect security vulnerabilities
3. Fix any issues found
4. Document security considerations in commit messages

## Documentation & Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Always Use Ref for Current Documentation**

Before implementing any library, framework, or API integration:

1. **Never guess or rely on potentially outdated knowledge**
2. **Always check Ref** for up-to-date documentation
3. **Use the Ref MCP tools** to fetch current API references and examples

**Example workflow:**
```typescript
// DON'T: Assume you know the API
const result = await streamText({ ... });  // Might be outdated

// DO: Check Ref first
// Use Ref tools to get current Vercel AI SDK documentation
// Then implement based on current docs
```

**Key libraries to always verify with Ref:**
- Vercel AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`)
- Next.js App Router patterns
- Zod schema validation
- shadcn/ui components
- Vercel KV caching API

**Why this matters:**
- APIs change frequently (especially Vercel AI SDK)
- Documentation from training data may be outdated
- Ref provides primary source documentation with 50% token savings vs Context7
- Prevents bugs from deprecated patterns
- Stateful sessions (never repeats same docs)

## Project Management & Git Workflow

**GitHub Issues and Regular Commits**

To maintain better traceability and project management:

1. **Create or update GitHub issues** as we work on tasks
   - Document what you're working on
   - Link commits to issues with keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #45")
   - Track progress and decisions

2. **Commit regularly** for better git history
   - Commit after completing logical units of work
   - Use descriptive commit messages following project conventions
   - Include issue references in commit messages
   - Push frequently to keep remote in sync

3. **Issue workflow:**
   - Start work â†’ Create/update issue with task details
   - During work â†’ Reference issue in commits
   - Complete work â†’ Close issue with final commit
   - Document decisions and blockers in issue comments

**Example commit message:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add suggestion component - Fixes #42

- Created interactive suggestion buttons
- Integrated with chat interface
- Added German-language prompts

## ðŸ”§ MCP Troubleshooting

### Semgrep
- **Error:** `command not found: semgrep`
  - **Fix:** `brew install semgrep` (v1.138.0+)
- **Error:** No output / empty results
  - **Fix:** Check file path is correct, ensure file has code to analyze

### Vibe-Check
- **Error:** `command not found: node`
  - **Fix:** Ensure Node.js installed, use absolute path if needed
- **Error:** Missing GEMINI_API_KEY
  - **Fix:** Set environment variable in .env or shell config

### Pieces
- **Error:** Connection refused on port 39300
  - **Fix:** Start PiecesOS application, enable LTM in settings
- **Empty results**
  - **Fix:** Wait 5-10 mins after enabling LTM (indexing delay)

### Ref
- **Error:** 401 Unauthorized
  - **Fix:** Verify API key in MCP config URL (`https://api.ref.tools/mcp?apiKey=your-key`)
- **Empty results**
  - **Tip:** Be specific with library names and versions
- **Advantage:** Stateful sessions never repeat same docs, 50% token savings vs Context7

### Exasearch
- **Error:** 403 Forbidden
  - **Fix:** Verify API key in environment or MCP config
- **Too many results**
  - **Tip:** Use specific queries (e.g., "Stripe Next.js TypeScript Server Actions")

### GitHub
- **403 Forbidden**
  - **Fix:** Check PAT scopes (need `repo`, `read:org`)
- **Private repo access denied**
  - **Fix:** Token must have `repo` scope

### Vercel
- **OAuth not authenticated**
  - **Fix:** Run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-vercel` manually first (opens browser)
- **Deployment failed**
  - **Check:** Build logs via `get_deployment_build_logs`

### Playwright
- **Test timeouts**
  - **Fix:** Increase timeout, ensure proper wait strategies
  - **Check:** Network conditions, async state updates
- **Element not found**
  - **Fix:** Use more specific selectors, wait for element visibility

### browser-use
- **Element index changed**
  - **Fix:** Call `browser_get_state` again after navigation
- **Click not working**
  - **Tip:** Ensure element is visible and interactive

## âš¡ Performance & Context Optimization

### Token Usage by MCP Layer

**Current Project MCPs:**
- Foundation (Semgrep, Vibe-Check): ~3K tokens
- Development (Ref, Exasearch, GitHub): ~6K tokens
- Testing (Playwright): ~2K tokens
- **Total:** ~11K tokens

**Recommended additions:**
- Pieces (memory): +2K tokens
- browser-use (automation): +1K tokens
- Vercel (deployment): +1K tokens
- Linear (team coordination): +2K tokens
- **New total:** ~17K tokens

### Context Management Tips

1. **Use mode-based loading**
   - Development mode: Ref, Exasearch, GitHub, Semgrep
   - Testing mode: Playwright, browser-use, Semgrep
   - Deployment mode: Vercel, GitHub, Semgrep
   - Team coordination: Linear, GitHub, Semgrep

2. **Remove MCPs when done**
   - Finished frontend work? Remove Vercel temporarily
   - Finished testing? Keep Playwright but remove browser-use

3. **Monitor context usage**
   - `/context` command - Visualize token usage
   - `/compact` command - Compress at ~70% capacity
   - `/clear` command - Reset between unrelated tasks

4. **Optimize MCP calls**
   - Semgrep: <1s for individual files
   - Ref: <2s for targeted docs (50% faster than Context7)
   - Exasearch: ~3s for code examples
   - Linear: <1s for issue operations
   - Playwright: Depends on test complexity

### Fastest Workflows

**Quick security check:** Semgrep â†’ Fix â†’ Commit (< 2 min)
**Quick doc lookup:** Ref â†’ Implement (< 1 min)
**Quick example search:** Exasearch â†’ Adapt code (< 2 min)
**Issue tracking:** Linear â†’ Create/update (< 30 sec)
**Full feature workflow:** 10-30 min depending on complexity
