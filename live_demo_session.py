**Bayer Leverkusen vs Paris St. Germain - Champions League**

Bayer Leverkusen suffered a devastating 7-2 defeat at home against PSG. This was
a particularly difficult match characterized by:

‚Ä¢ **The Score:** 7-2 loss at the BayArena
‚Ä¢ **Coach's Analysis:** Kasper Hjulmand described it as receiving a "lesson" from PSG
‚Ä¢ **Critical Period:** The coach pointed to a crucial 7-minute span after the
  equalizer where the team showed naivety
‚Ä¢ **Match Statistics:** 9 total goals, 2 penalties, and red cards were issued
‚Ä¢ **Context:** This was a Champions League match that featured an entertaining
  but ultimately one-sided affair

The coach's comment about "losing the game in seven minutes" suggests there was
a specific period where PSG capitalized on Leverkusen's defensive lapses."""

‚Ä¢ Coach Niko Kovac was pleased with the second-half performance
‚Ä¢ Kovac mentioned the team "shifted up at least one gear" after the break

"different beds" (possibly referring to travel/away conditions).

Demonstration Complete!

**What You Just Saw:**
‚Ä¢ Real sports data fetched from Kicker.de and TheSportsDB
‚Ä¢ 5 different query types processed
‚Ä¢ Natural language understanding of user intent
‚Ä¢ Detailed responses with context and analysis
‚Ä¢ Proper source attribution and data freshness

**This Simulates:**
The exact interaction you'd get with the Agent SDK, where:
1. User sends a question
2. Agent receives question + sports data context
3. Agent (Claude) analyzes and responds
4. Response streams back to user

**Key Capabilities Demonstrated:**
‚úì Match result analysis
‚úì Player performance details
‚úì News summarization
‚úì Schedule information
‚úì Multi-source data integration
‚úì Context-aware responses

**Next Steps:**
‚Ä¢ Set up Anthropic API key to run real agent
‚Ä¢ Customize system prompt for different sports focus
‚Ä¢ Add more data sources (Bundesliga API, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Build web interface on top

The agent architecture is ready - just needs your API key to go live!
