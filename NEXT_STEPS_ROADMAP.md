# KSI Development Roadmap
**Post-Benchmark Next Steps**

---

## Current Status: ✅ Benchmark Complete

**Completed:**
- 8-model LLM evaluation
- Fair testing protocol validated
- Production recommendation: Mistral Large
- Complete findings documented

**Decision Made:** Mistral Large (7.33/10 quality @ 3.64s)

---

## Phase 1: Kicker-Ready Prototype (CURRENT FOCUS)

**Goal:** Working demo Kicker can interact with

**Deliverables:**
1. CLI tool with Mistral Large integration
2. Real Bundesliga data integration
3. 10-20 example queries that work well
4. Simple README for Kicker to test

**Success Criteria:**
- Responds to German sports queries in <5s
- Quality matches benchmark (7.33/10)
- No crashes, handles missing data gracefully
- Kicker can run it themselves

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Phase 2: Production Validation (AFTER PROTOTYPE)

### Immediate Validation (Week 1-2)

**1. Cost Analysis**
- Track actual $/1M tokens for Mistral Large
- Compare to Claude Sonnet, GPT-5 Mini
- Calculate cost per query at scale
- **Output:** Cost comparison table

**2. Production Query Testing**
- Run 100-500 real Kicker queries
- Monitor: speed, quality, failure rate
- Validate benchmark predictions hold
- **Output:** Production performance report

**3. Streaming Performance**
- Measure time-to-first-token (TTFT)
- Test for real-time UI responsiveness
- Validate 3.64s average in streaming mode
- **Output:** Streaming latency metrics

### Short-Term Validation (Week 3-4)

**4. A/B Testing**
Run top 3 models in parallel:
- Mistral Large (primary recommendation)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (backup option)
- GPT-5 Mini (quality comparison)

**Metrics:**
- Quality (Kicker user ratings)
- Speed (p50, p95, p99)
- Cost ($/1000 queries)
- Reliability (failure rate)

**Output:** Final model selection with data

**5. Long-Context Testing**
- Current tests: ~1200 tokens
- Production needs: Full game summaries, multi-match analysis
- Test: 4K, 8K, 16K token contexts
- **Output:** Context length recommendations

**6. Multi-Turn Conversation**
- All tests were single-turn
- Production: Follow-up questions, clarifications
- Test: 3-5 turn conversations
- **Output:** Conversation quality metrics

---

## Phase 3: Web API Development (AFTER VALIDATION)

**Goal:** Transform CLI → Production API

**Architecture:**
```
CLI Prototype (✅) → Web API (FastAPI) → Frontend Integration
```

**Components:**
1. **Backend API** (FastAPI/Flask)
   - `/query` endpoint (single question)
   - `/conversation` endpoint (multi-turn)
   - Rate limiting, caching
   - Monitoring/logging

2. **Data Pipeline**
   - Live Bundesliga data feed
   - Real-time score updates
   - News aggregation
   - Cache strategy (Redis)

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Kicker.de widget
   - Standalone demo page
   - Mobile responsiveness

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks

---

## Phase 4: Optimization & Scale (AFTER WEB API)

### Cost Optimization

**Smart Model Routing:**
- Simple queries → Mistral Small (cheap, fast)
- Complex analysis → GPT-5 Mini (quality)
- Standard queries → Mistral Large (balanced)

**Caching Strategy:**
- Common queries cached (e.g., "Who leads Bundesliga?")
- Time-sensitive queries bypass cache
- Estimated: 40-60% query reduction

### Performance Optimization

**Response Speed:**
- Parallel data fetching
- Streaming responses (TTFT <500ms)
- Preload common context

**Quality Improvements:**
- Fine-tune on Kicker editorial style
- Domain-specific vocabulary
- Fact-checking layer

**Monitoring:**
- Real-time dashboards
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Cost monitoring (per query)
- User satisfaction tracking

**Timeline:** 2-3 months

## Decision Points

### Before Phase 2 (Production Validation)

**Question 1: Is benchmark quality sufficient?**
- Mistral Large: 7.33/10
- Kicker requirement: ?/10
- **Action:** Get Kicker quality threshold

**Question 2: What's the budget?**
- Need cost analysis to finalize
- May influence model choice
- **Action:** Cost analysis in Phase 2

**Question 3: Deployment timeline?**
- Quick prototype → Skip A/B, use Mistral Large
- Production-ready → Full validation first
- **Action:** Confirm with Kicker

### Before Phase 3 (Web API)

**Question 4: Hosting strategy?**
- Cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Serverless vs containers
- **Action:** Infrastructure planning

**Question 5: Integration requirements?**
- Kicker.de CMS integration
- Standalone product
- **Action:** Technical discovery with Kicker

### Before Phase 4 (Optimization)

**Question 6: Traffic expectations?**
- Queries per day/hour
- Peak load (game days)
- **Action:** Capacity planning

## Open Questions from Benchmark

**Still need to investigate:**

1. **Cost Comparison**
   - $/1M tokens not evaluated
   - Need real pricing data
   - Calculate total cost of ownership

2. **Long-Context Performance**
   - Tests used ~1200 tokens
   - Production may need 4K-16K
   - Quality degradation unknown

3. **Streaming Latency**
   - Only measured total response time
   - TTFT (time-to-first-token) critical for UX
   - Need streaming benchmarks

4. **Multi-Turn Quality**
   - All tests single-turn
   - Conversation context handling unknown
   - Need conversation benchmarks

5. **Fine-Tuning Potential**
   - Can we improve on 7.33/10?
   - Domain adaptation for Kicker style
   - ROI of fine-tuning vs prompt engineering

## Recommended Immediate Actions

**Priority 1: Build Kicker Prototype**
```bash
# Focus: Working demo Kicker can use
# Timeline: 1-2 weeks
# Outcome: Tangible product
```

**Priority 2: Cost Analysis**
```bash
# Parallel to prototype development
# Quick research task
# Informs final model decision
```

**Priority 3: Get Kicker Feedback**
```bash
# After prototype ready
# Validate direction
# Identify gaps
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- Model quality degrades in production → A/B test first
- Cost too high → Smart routing, caching
- Speed too slow → Streaming, optimization

**Business Risks:**
- Kicker rejects quality → GPT-5 Mini fallback
- Timeline pressure → Skip A/B, deploy Mistral Large
- Budget constraints → Start with Mistral Small

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Prototype first (low cost, fast feedback)
- Validate before committing to infrastructure
- Keep multiple model options ready

---

## Next Review

**After Prototype Complete:**
1. Kicker feedback session
2. Cost analysis results
3. Decision: Proceed to Phase 2 or iterate
4. Updated timeline based on learnings

**Questions for Next Review:**
- Is quality acceptable to Kicker?
- What's missing from prototype?
- What's the budget for production?
- What's the launch timeline?
