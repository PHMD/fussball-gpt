# Kicker Sports Intelligence (KSI): Prototype Development Brief

**Objective:** Develop a functional command-line interface (CLI) prototype for the Kicker Sports Intelligence (KSI) platform. This prototype will serve as a proof-of-concept by aggregating real, publicly available sports data, integrating it with a Large Language Model (LLM), and allowing for natural language interaction.

**Core Task:** The end-to-end flow is:
1.  Fetch and aggregate news and sports data from specified public sources.
2.  Accept a user's natural language query via a CLI.
3.  Use an LLM to process the query against the aggregated data (RAG pattern).
4.  Print the AI-generated response back to the CLI.

## Phase 1: Data Aggregation & Streaming

**Goal:** Create Python scripts to connect to and normalize data from available public sources.

*   **Task 1: Kicker News Integration**
    *   Use the Python client `kickerde-api-client` to fetch news articles from Kicker.de.
    *   **Source:** [[ksi_prototype_specification#5-technical-considerations-for-prototype-development|Prototype Specification]]
    *   **Action:** Write a script (`data_aggregator.py`) that can retrieve and parse the latest articles.

*   **Task 2: Kicker RSS Feed Integration**
    *   Integrate the Kicker RSS feed for another stream of live news.
    *   **Source:** [https://newsfeed.kicker.de/opml](https://newsfeed.kicker.de/opml)
    *   **Action:** Add functionality to `data_aggregator.py` to parse this RSS feed.

*   **Task 3: Public Sports Data API Integration**
    *   Choose and integrate a public sports data API (e.g., TheSportsDB, or another free alternative) to fetch real-time scores, schedules, and stats.
    *   **Action:** Add functionality to `data_aggregator.py` to fetch this data.

*   **Task 4: Data Normalization**
    *   **Action:** Ensure that the data from all sources is transformed into a consistent, simple format (e.g., a list of dictionaries or Pydantic models) that can be easily fed to the LLM. Each item should have a clear `source`, `title`, `content`, and `timestamp`.

## Phase 2: AI Integration & CLI Shell

**Goal:** Build a simple, interactive command-line interface to test the core AI functionality.

*   **Task 1: Create CLI Environment**
    *   **Action:** Create a main script (`cli.py`) that provides a simple `while True` loop to accept user input from the command line.

*   **Task 2: Integrate Data Stream**
    *   **Action:** In `cli.py`, import and use the `data_aggregator.py` to fetch fresh data for each user query or on a regular interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).

*   **Task 3: LLM Integration (RAG)**
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Take the user's query from the CLI.
        2.  Take the aggregated data from Phase 1.
        3.  Construct a prompt for an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4 or Anthropic's Claude) that includes both the user's query and the aggregated data as context.
        4.  Send the prompt to the LLM API.
        5.  Receive the response from the LLM.

*   **Task 4: Display Response**
    *   **Action:** Print the AI-generated response cleanly to the console.

## Phase 3: Front-End Integration (Future Scope)

*   **Goal:** To be addressed *after* the CLI prototype is functional and validated.
*   **Description:** The backend logic developed in Phases 1 and 2 will be exposed via a lightweight web framework (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) to be consumed by a web-based front-end. This is not part of the immediate task.
